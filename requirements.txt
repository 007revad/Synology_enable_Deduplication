Because the bc command is not included in DSM you need to install "SynoCli misc. Tools" from SynoCommunity for this script to work.

1. Package Center > Settings > Package Sources > Add
2. Name:  SynoCommunity
3. Location: https://packages.synocommunity.com/
4. Click OK and OK again.
5. Click Community on the left.
6. Install SynoCli misc. Tools
